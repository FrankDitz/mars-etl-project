## Overview
A full web-scraping and data analysis project that uses knowledge of HTML to extract information via automated browsing (Splinter) and HTML parsing (Beautiful Soup library). For this project, I used automated browsing to visit and extract information from the Mars Temperature Data Site. After doing so, I created a basic csv file to house the data before processing and transforming the scraped data into a usable format. Lastly, I performed analytical techniques to discover and visualize the answers to questions like “Which months have the highest and lowest atmospheric pressure on Mars?” and “What is the average daily minimum temperature on Mars for each month?”

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to test my ability to extract, transform, and load data that I found on a reputable website and perform basic analytical techniques to analyze and visualize the data and data trends. As ETL processes are crucial to solving any problem in the data analytics field, it is imperative to train and improve upon these skills. In this way, the mars-etl-project served to improve my data extraction skills through practicing automated browsing and HTML parsing, two premiere ways of obtaining data from websites.
